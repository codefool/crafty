craftyrc(5)                                                                                                                           craftyrc(5)

NAME
       crafty.rc, .craftyrc  - run control for crafty(6)

DESCRIPTION
       A  Crafty  run control file should contain a sequence of valid Crafty commands, terminated by the command "exit" to restore standard input
       to the keyboard.  This manual page gives a skeletal example.  Even the few commands used are not fully explained, and should be looked  up
       in "crafty.doc".  As for where the run control file should be, see crafty(6).

EXAMPLE
       # $HOME/.craftyrc (comments like this are fine).

       ! echo "Reading $HOME/.craftyrc ..."
       # Crafty's shell escape "!" lets us at system commands.
       # Echoed information will be in "log.001".

       # PROCESSOR USAGE:

       mt=0
       # The "mt" command indicates how many processors to use.
       # With zero, multiprocessor support is disabled.
       # If Crafty has been compiled without SMP support,
       # a harmless error message results.

       # MEMORY USAGE:

       hash=24M
       # Memory allowed for transposition hash table.

       hashp=3M
       # Memory for pawn structure hash table.
       # These commands are well explained in "crafty.doc".
       # Hopefully, someone will step in and rewrite this
       # example to properly use the more intricate "adaptive".

       # ENDGAME TABLEBASES:

       egtb !
       # Enable tablebases.
       # The "!" has Crafty pat us on the head if we happen to
       # play a good move in the late endgame.

       cache=1M
       # Define memory usage for caching tablebase probe info.

       # OUTPUT TUNING:

       show book
       # Make Crafty verbose in the opening.

       # FINALLY, RESTORE CRAFTY'S INPUT TO THE KEYBOARD:

       exit

       # End of $HOME/.craftyrc
